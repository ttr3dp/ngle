ngle - NVIDIA Toggle
--------------------

Dumb tool for disabling and enabling NVIDIA discrete card on hybrid Intel/NVIDIA laptops.



Why?
----

I was stupid enough to purchase an NVIDIA Optimus laptop where all outputs are connected to discrete NVIDIA card.
This means if I cannot power off NVIDIA card if I want to use external monitor.
Leaving the discrete card always powered on means sacrificing battery life.

There are already existing solutions like optimus-manager, bumblebee, nvidia-switch,
but those are too complex and error prone and milage may vary depending on the laptop specs and distro.
I'm not using a display manager and with these solutions I always end up adding stuff to .xinitrc or .profile.



How is ngle different?
----------------------

It is dead simple and works for my use-case:

- I don't mind rebooting in order to turn the NVIDIA card on/off



How does it work?
---------------------

- When NVIDIA card is disabled/powered down:
    - It will copy a specific Xorg config to /etc/X11/xorg.conf (stolen from https://github.com/nvidiaswitch/nvidia-switch/)
    - It will clear NVIDIA module(s) blacklisting
    - It will remove udev rules for fully powering down the card

- When NVIDIA card is enabled:
    - It will remove /etc/X11/xorg.conf
    - It will blacklist NVIDIA module(s)
    - It will add udev rule for powering down the card



Installation
------------

$ ./install.sh



Usage
-----

$ ngle && reboot
